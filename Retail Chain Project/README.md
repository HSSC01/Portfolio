# Retail Chain Project
This project uses a **synthetically generated dataset** that simulates real-world sales transaction data for a large UK-based retail chain.  

- The **dataset** was generated using Python and includes **1.5 million rows** of transactional data.  
- The **business scenario** and challenges were provided by ChatGPT, mimicking realistic struggles a retail company may face.  
- The **goal** of this project is to **perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and create a **Power BI dashboard** to extract actionable insights.  

### **Company Overview**
