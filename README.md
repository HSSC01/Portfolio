# Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here are some of my projects:

## Projects

### [VLCC Fleet Utilisation Analysis](https://github.com/HSSC01/Portfolio/tree/main/VLCC%20Fleet%20Utilisation)  
A **data analysis and reporting simulation project** focusing on operational fleet efficiency in the maritime shipping industry (VLCC tankers). This project analyses **monthly fleet activity data** (Idle, Loaded, Ballast days) to calculate utilisation rates, identify underperforming vessels and routes, and provide actionable recommendations for improving deployment.

**Skills:** Python, Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Outlier Detection, Business Reporting, Visual Storytelling  


### [Retail Chain Project](https://github.com/HSSC01/Portfolio/tree/main/Retail%20Chain%20Project)  
An end-to-end **data engineering and analysis project** simulating a retail chainâ€™s operations with **1.5 million rows of self-generated synthetic data**. Involves:  
- **Python**: Generating realistic, messy datasets with sales, products, and customer data.  
- **SQL**: Cleaning and combining the datasets within Python.  
- **EDA & Reporting**: Identifying key trends and insights.  

**Skills:** Python, SQL, Data Cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Visualisation  


### [Telco Customer Churn](https://github.com/HSSC01/Portfolio/tree/main/Telco%20Customer%20Churn)
This project, chosen as part of the **IBM** course projects, focuses on analysing customer churn in a telecommunications company. It includes steps such as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and the application of **supervised machine learning** techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models that predict customer churn, using various classification algorithms to identify key factors influencing customer retention.

**Skills:** Python, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Visualisation, Feature Engineering, Supervised Machine Learning, Pipelines
