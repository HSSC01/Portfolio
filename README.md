### [Telco Customer Churn](https://github.com/HSSC01/Portfolio/tree/main/Telco%20Customer%20Churn)
This project, chosen as part of the IBM course projects, focuses on analysing customer churn in a telecommunications company. It includes steps such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models that predict customer churn, using various classification algorithms to identify key factors influencing customer retention.
